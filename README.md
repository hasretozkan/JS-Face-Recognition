# Face Recognition with Javascript

I designed you face recognition system with js. In the example, we understand if you are happy according to your facial expression.

## [Demo](https://restorantapp-5622b.web.app/)

## Setup

 - Download files or fork zip. 
 - Copy models .
 - Copy the face-api-min.js file. 
 - Try to understand the codes in the JS file :)

In this project I made you face recognition simply. In the meantime, I tried to sample what variables we got.
